We started One Voice Basketball because we want every kid to experience the joy and satisfaction of being a part of something bigger than themselves. We want kids to experience the satisfaction that comes from investing in their own personal growth and sacrificing so that others can grow as well. Participating on a true team – one that shares a commitment to a common purpose, brings together the complementary skills of all the participants, works towards shared goals and demands accountability to those commitments – is a life changing experience. Teams are like families – they connect us to others and to a larger purpose. Basketball, when played correctly, is a beautiful game and offers one of the best vehicles for individual expression in a team context.

We continue to run One Voice because the Voorhees girls’ basketball program has a unique history that should be sustained for girls in the years to come. It’s tied to the history of our communities as sisters, cousins, neighbors, babysitters and now even aunts and moms played in the program in years past. Many of today’s players grew up watching these players perform. We do it because we love the game of basketball and the opportunities it presents for learning lifelong lessons – committing to work hard for yourself and others, working through frustration and failure, stretching your perceived limits (and finding out you can do more than you think you can do) and learning to trust – people and processes. We do it because others did it for us and gave each of us a gift that cannot be easily repaid. We want to give back because they gave to us.

## ONE VOICE PHILOSOPHY

### TEAM FIRST

This isn’t about you the player, it is about all of you, the team.

Our program is about teaching players the skills to play a team game. In the process of learning how to be the best teammate possible you’ll learn lessons that can impact your life in positive ways.

While playing college basketball may be a nice outcome of your work it is not a goal of our program.

### THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL SKILL

Catching the ball, using proper footwork and balance to face the basket and bringing your eyes to the rim. Bringing our eyes to the rim allows your peripheral vision to see the bigger picture – the court, all the players on the court and the space available. When you see the court you are in a position to offer your unique skills - passing, dribbling or scoring - for the benefit of the team.

### OFFENSIVE PHILOSOPHY

We expect every player on the court to be a threat to the defense. For us that means on the catch every player faces up, bringing their eyes to the rim, and challenges their defender. It can be as simple as a jab step or one or two dribbles. We expect every player to challenge the defense every time they touch the ball. When they do that all the off-ball defenders have to be aware of their help responsibilities. A single dribble can result in a help defender adjusting to help. It can get the defense to move. Whenever you get the defense to move you will create better offensive opportunities. Attention to detail (such as proper use of a screen, hard cuts) and discipline (running your schemes through until you create the best scoring opportunity) allow teams with less offensive skill to compete.

Conversely, when players simply catch and pass, often without even looking at the basket, the offense is basically playing 4 on 5. The same is true for players who catch a pass and immediately raise the ball overhead reducing triple threat opportunities to single threat (passing) opportunities. Passive players allow the defense to relax, sag into the passing lanes or maintain their desired spacing and react quicker in help situations. We want the defense to be aware of the player with the ball, forced to split their attention on the ball and their assigned player and put them in a situation that requires help and recover / close outs. Help, recover and close out situations often lead to better attack angles for the offensive player and the breakdown of defensive structure – more space, more offensive scoring opportunities.

### ZONE OFFENSE – FOCUS POINTS

Attack the gaps in the zone – with the dribble, flashing into the gaps for a pass or positioning post players in the gaps – to occupy the defense.

Move the defense; ball reversal – either through the high post or passing around the perimeter.

On ball reversal – challenge the defense. For example, if the ball goes into the high post, the post player must face up. This holds the defense in the lane and slows their response to anticipated passes to the wings.

On ball reversal – pass on the perimeter to reverse the ball. Every player must 1st attack the gap in front of them before passing. This again slows the defense’s response to anticipated passes. When the ball reaches the top the guard must “freeze” the elbow defender by dribbling at her before passing to the wing. If we fail to freeze the elbow defender it allows the defender to anticipate the pass, stepping into the passing lane between the top and the wing. An intercepted pass or, in a best case scenario, a high, slow pass to the wing results.

### MAN DEFENSE

Ball pressure disrupts offensive flow. Trust your teammates to rotate and help when needed.

Deny the post entry from the wing and front the post entry from the corner.

Neutralize height advantages in the low post with proper denial / front technique and pressure on the passer.

Ball pressure and post denial / front require the defender to trust her teammates to rotate and help if needed.

Close out to the baseline shoulder to force dribble penetration to the inside.

### ZONE DEFENSE – FOCUS POINTS

Protect the zone gaps – know your gap responsibilities and anticipate passes, cutters or dribble attacks in the gaps.

Defend the 3 point line using proper close outs. Close out to the baseline shoulder to force dribble penetration to the inside.

Know what hurts you –for example, if a player can’t hit a long shot we don’t need to defend outside the boundaries of their abilities. Leaving our zone structure to defend a player who is not a threat to score leaves us vulnerable at the foul line which can lead to easy scoring opportunities.

Communicate. Be aware of the shooters. let your teammates know when offensive players are cutting or relocating. When the zone offense utilizes screens let your teammate know the screen is coming and help if necessary. Use your hands on the screener to establish space for your feet (allowing you to get around the screen vs. trying to push through).
