about_page_title: Our Purpose - Why One Voice Basketball Exists
about_page_intro: >-
  Changed We started One Voice Basketball because we want every kid to
  experience the joy and satisfaction of being a part of something bigger than
  themselves. We want kids to experience the satisfaction that comes from
  investing in their own personal growth and sacrificing so that others can grow
  as well. Participating on a true team – one that shares a commitment to a
  common purpose, brings together the complementary skills of all the
  participants, works towards shared goals and demands accountability to those
  commitments – is a life changing experience. Teams are like families – they
  connect us to others and to a larger purpose. Basketball, when played
  correctly, is a beautiful game and offers one of the best vehicles for
  individual expression in a team context.


  We continue to run One Voice because the Voorhees girls’ basketball program has a unique history that should be sustained for girls in the years to come. It’s tied to the history of our communities as sisters, cousins, neighbors, babysitters and now even aunts and moms played in the program in years past. Many of today’s players grew up watching these players perform. We do it because we love the game of basketball and the opportunities it presents for learning lifelong lessons – committing to work hard for yourself and others, working through frustration and failure, stretching your perceived limits (and finding out you can do more than you think you can do) and learning to trust – people and processes. We do it because others did it for us and gave each of us a gift that cannot be easily repaid. We want to give back because they gave to us.

      This isn’t about you the player, it is about all of you, the team.


      Our program is about teaching players the skills to play a team game. In the process of learning how to be the best teammate possible you’ll learn lessons that can impact your life in positive ways.


      While playing college basketball may be a nice outcome of your work it is not a goal of our program.
