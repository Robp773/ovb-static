      Bob Peterman started One Voice Basketball in 2010. Bob brings more than 35
      years of coaching experience to the program.


      Over the years Bob has worked as the C.O.O. of Bonnie Brae, a residential treatment program for emotionally disturbed youth, President of the Board of Trustees of Hunterdon Youth Services, Plant Superintendent, HR Director and Corporate Trainer at Custom Alloy Corporation and Vice President of Blueprints for Breakthroughs, a consulting firm that aims to maximize human potential in individuals and groups. Throughout his career his primary responsibilities included developing high performing teams of people dedicated to a common purpose.


      While at Bonnie Brae, Bob was a founder of an adventure based counseling program that was named one of the top five programs in the world by Project Adventure Inc. in 2003. As one of the program’s wilderness guides, Bob utilized challenge course activities, backpacking, canoeing, snowshoe and cross country skiing expeditions to help youth at risk identify and enhance their personal strengths and work through their perceived limits.


      All of these experiences have influenced Bob’s coaching philosophy. He believes that coaching is not only about athletic skill development but also about personal development. Coaching, in his opinion, involves assisting players to work through obstacles, conflicts and confidence barriers and towards their potential. He believes that limits on human potential are largely self-imposed and that basketball can provide a platform that provides kids an opportunity to work through the challenges of athletic competition, affirm their personal values and demonstrate their character.
